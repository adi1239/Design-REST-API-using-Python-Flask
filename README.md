# REST-API-using-Python

APIs are like mechanisms used to communicate with applications and other software. They also provide to communicate various other components using the software.

REST is one of the most common APIs. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to communicate.

Here, I am demonstrating a RESTful design using Python Flask Web app.

User can perform GET and POST functions.

CURL or POSTMAN can be used to testout the RESTful API.
